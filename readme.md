This implementation introduces a proof-of-work system into the blockchain,
simulating a simple mining process. The difficulty can be adjusted, and each block's integrity 
is ensured by requiring the hash to meet a specific condition,
making it computationally expensive to add blocks, just like in real-world blockchains such as Bitcoin.
